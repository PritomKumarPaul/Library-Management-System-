Our project is library management system. Here a user can issue books online and the librarian can control the books issued, 
taken and returned through librarians dashboard. New user has to register. Existing users can login. Users or the library 
members can issue books online but they have a maximum limit of three unreturned issued books at a time. If the limit crosses 
he can't issue books. Then comes the librarians part. He can add new books. He can record the entry and exit time of a member 
of library by using the monitor feature. Librarians can keep track of which members actually took their issued books thruogh 
the give feature. Finally librarians can record the books returned by the students.
